# List-Impl

## LIST Implementation using Linked CellsThe goal for this project was to create a general list ADT (LIST) using linked cells to do it. This implementation contains a doubly linked list, having the operations to put an element into the list, to take an element out, and to retrieve an element (without altering the data structure). The implementation contains an operation telling how many elements are stored in the list, a boolean to tell if it is empty or not, and an operation to make a fresh, empty list.
